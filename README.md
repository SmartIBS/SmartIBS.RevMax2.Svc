# SmartIBS.RevMax2.Svc

This is a wraper around the RevmaxAPI V2 provided by Axis Solutions. It allows for easy access to RevMax fiscal devices though a web service. I wrote this originaly for SmartIBS POS so this first iteration n V2 is meant to keep compatibility with SmartIBS but also introducing new features like License registration.
